GUIBuilder
===========
This code is a sketch of something that should happen, if the world was a better place than it is.

It builds GUIs. It has no sytem to connect the GUI to code, so is currently as a reusable tool only a demo. Also it is only fitted for GTK, and a small set at that.

But it's a good demo. It has been robustness-tested in a pub on sticky tables. 

State
------
I don't intend to take this code any further right now. It has nowhere to go.

Awards
-------
This code has passed a "Can I hold your attention?" test.

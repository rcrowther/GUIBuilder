GUIBuilder
===========
This code is a sketch of something that should happen, if the world was a better place than it is.

It builds GUIs. It has no system to connect the GUI to code, so is currently as a reusable tool only a demo. Also it is only fitted for GTK, and a small set at that.

But it's a good demo. It has been robustness-tested in a pub on sticky tables. 

State
------
I don't intend to take this code any further right now. It has nowhere to go.

Set up thre code and environment as described in the text/COMPILE file. Then read the file text/USAGE, or mod some of the demos. Or run, ::

    ./builder.py -vl -ss test_style test_widget_gallery_struct


Awards
-------
This code has passed a "Can I hold your attention?" test.
